        <h2>About Real Madrid</h2>
        <p>
            Real Madrid Club de Fútbol, commonly referred to as Real Madrid, is a Spanish professional 
            football club based in Madrid. Founded in 1902, the club has worn its iconic white kit 
            since its earliest days.

            Real Madrid isn’t just a football club — it’s the sporting equivalent of a blockbuster movie franchise. Every season feels like a new episode where the cast features world-class megastars, the budget somehow keeps getting bigger, and the plot twist is usually them lifting another trophy. Draped in pristine white (because when you win that often, you don’t mind getting grass stains), Los Blancos have built a reputation as football’s final boss. Opponents don’t just play them — they hope to survive them. The Bernabéu is their fortress: part stadium, part museum, part pressure cooker, where last-minute comebacks somehow feel like a scheduled activity. From Galácticos past and present to Champions League nights that look scripted by Hollywood, Real Madrid remains the team everyone either dreams of playing for or dreams of beating — usually unsuccessfully.
